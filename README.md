This is deep learning project which helps to detect if someone is putting on a face mask or not. It shows a green box if there is face mask  and red if no face mask.

To run, after cloning this repo, in the root directory, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the necessary requirements.
Then run the "detect_mask_video.py" file to start the script.

It would open your webcam and you can see the detections.
